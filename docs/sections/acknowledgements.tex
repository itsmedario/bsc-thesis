First of all, I would like to thank \textit{Prof. Dr. Juraj Hromkovic} for the offer to supervise my Bachelor's thesis, for the friendly welcome and uncomplicated procedure, and for the feedback during the thesis. The opportunity given to me was a unique chance to dive into software development and has taught me a lot in various areas of software engineering.

Also, I would like to express my gratitude to \textit{Regula Lacher} as well as \textit{Dr. Elizabeta Cavar} for the ongoing support throughout the project. By their constructive feedback and useful tips, I learned a lot, and it motivated me to keep going. 

Further, my family and friends have helped me a lot with their support, encouragement and feedback, even in providing contacts to test the project in different elementary schools and testing the environment themselves. I'm very thankful for each one of them.

Last but not least, special thanks are given to the proofreaders \textit{Esther Naepfer} and \textit{Markus Naepfer}.
