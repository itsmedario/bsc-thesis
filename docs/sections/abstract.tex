This thesis gives an outline of the project and implementation of an online learning environment that teaches important concepts from the \textit{ABZ} textbook 'einfach Informatik 3/4'. This book is about to be published in order to reinforce the emerging focus on the field of IT in elementary school. The implemented task sets of 'einfach Informatik 3/4' deal with the autonomous solving of problems.

The learning environment will be analysed in-depth such that the reader is introduced to the various design choices as well as the architecture of the program. Also, the task concept will be covered and, finally, an assessment of live testing of the learning environment will be exhaustively discussed.
